# Adipose_Tissue_Model
MATLAB implementation of physiology based mathematical model of postprandial adipose tissue metabolism

The code for the implementation of the adipose tissue model described in O'Donovan et al.A computational 
model of postprandial adipose tissue lipid metabolism derived using human arteriovenous stable isotope 
tracer data. PLOS Comp. Bio. (2019) 15(10): e1007400. is provided as Matlab m-files (MATLAB 2014b, The 
MathWorks Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, United States.) The provided folder contains implementations 
of the adipose tissue model, parameter estimation, model analysis and visualisation. The folder also
contains a sample data file "sample data.mat". The sample data consists a Matlab structure
containing a time series of simulated postprandial adipose tissue flux data and arterial
metabolite concentrations in the format required for the implementation of the model.
The scripts for parameters estimation and flux predictions are outlined in further detail in the file
model_description.pdf.
